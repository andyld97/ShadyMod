## Shady Mod

This mod adds 12 Scrap-Items to the game (related to our clan):
- 7 Minecraft Heads
- 5 other Items

With a Minecraft-Head, you can teleport yourself to the player (only works for our clan members)

When holding a head in your hand, you'll receive a perk!
Perks can be useful but are not always beneficial. Some may be consumed upon use, while others are just for fun.
Some perks are increased if a player holds it's own head!

A big thank you to all team members, and especially to belebt, for her invaluable help with testing!

Currently this mod only adds Scrap-Items, later on I plan to add enemies too (future plans)

Be a `great asset` and have fun!
